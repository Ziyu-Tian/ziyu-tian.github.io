# Pway Class A - LU

## 1: Introduction 

### 1.1: Definition of Permanent Way and Track 

- **Permanent Way**:
    - All railway tracks in passenger service, the adjointing depots and sidings mostly electrified, timber / sleepers, cuttings, embankments, drainage and all associated features between and including the operational boundary fences.

- **Track**:
    - The permanent way and the ground within 2 m of any running rail, but exlcuing station platforms and areas guarded by physical barriar.

### 1.2: Main Components of PWay

- Running rails & joints
- Switches and corssings
- Rail fastening 
- Sleepers and timbers
- Conductor rails and fittings
- Ballast and concrete
- Track Drainage 
- Surface vegetation 
- Boudndary fences
- Train arresters 
- Structure gauge

### 1.3: Purpose of the PWay 

- Support and guide the trains
- Provide a suitable running surface for wheels
- Provide adequate space for approved vehicles travelling at authorised speed
- Provide a suitable path for collector shoes
- Provide electrical paths & insulation for power and signalling
- Provide safe walking surface for maintenance / derailment 
- Enable drainage of surface water

### 1.4: Platform Train Interface (PTI)

- Important to safety and service performance
- Maybe necessary to use special measures to fix the track position
- Preference is to standardise dimensions between tracks and platform edge, but this can result in sub-optimal solutions

### 1.5: Wheel Rail Interface (WRI)

- The wheel treads are tapered and the rails are inclined at 1 in 20 to provide self steering.
- The wheels have flanges which on tighter radius curves (radius approximately 400 metres)
- The shape of the rial head and wheel profile are very important, including track gauge and track geometry.
- Lubrication is provided by track lubricators and in some cases also train mounted lubricators.

### 1.6: Conductor Rail - Shoe Gear Interface

- Necessary to have gap in the consuctor rails and ramps to guide shoes on and off the rails.
- Most conductor rails are steel but aluminium rails with a stainless steel top surface are also used for higher conductivity.

### 1.7: Point Systems

- Provide motor drives, position detection and locking mechanisms.
- In LU, switch rails and stretcher bars are classfied as PWay assets and the drive, detection and locking system classified as Signal assets.

### 1.8: Track Condition Monitoring 

Various condition measures are used for each form of degradtion:

- Irreversible Degradation:
  - Running rail wear
  - Running rail flaws
  - Conductor rail wear
- Reversible Degradation:
  - Running rail corrugation
  - Loss of track geometry
  - Ballast contamination (eg. wet beds)

LU PWay standards mandate a suite of inspections that provide information about track condition:

- Patrolling - visual
- Junctionwork Inspections - visual and measured
- Measured Inspections - work scoping 
- Track Recording Vehicle (TRV), ATMS
- Rail Inspections - 'B' scan (ultrasonic), RSCM (magnetic flux)
- Prevention of Bukcling Inspections 


## 2: Plain Line & Junctionwork

### 2.1: Running Rails 

- Purpose - to carry and guide the train wheels
- Required to distribute significant forces
- Properties:
  - Hardness - to resist wear
  - Toughness - to absord load and resist fatigue 
  - Tensile strength - to withstand thermal forces
- Also used to locate signals equipments
- Material Most Used:
  - Normal Grade steel - historical used
  - Grade A steel - standard use
  - Premium Steels & Head Hardened - wear resistant 

### 2.2: Track Forms

- Bullhead (BH) - Traditional 

- Flat Bottom (FB) - New Works

- General Track Guage:
  - Straight Track: 1435 mm
  - Check Rail Curves: 1438 mm

### 2.3: Running Rail Joints

- Purpose - to connect together lengths of rail to form a secure path
- Welded Types:
  - Flash butt weld (workshop process)
  - Thermic (site welding process)
- Fishplated (mechanical connection):
  - Expansion (for short rails)
  - Tight
  - Junction
  - Blockjoint

### 2.4: Sleepers

- Purpose - to maintain gauge
  - Maintain dimension between rails
  - Maintain coss level
  - Support running and conductor rails
  - Distribute dynamic and static loads

#### 2.4.1: Sleepers Type

- **Softwood** - ballasted track only
  - PRO: inexpensive, lightweight
  - AGAINST: Easy to splitting and rotting 
- **Hardwood** - ballasted and mainly concreted track
  - PRO: duarbale, lighter than concrete
  - AGAINST: exotic and expensive
- **Composite**
  - FOR: Eco-friendly
  - AGAINST: flammable, heat distortion 
- **Prestressed concrete** - ballasted and concreted
  - FOR: inexpensive, strong and stable
  - AGAINST: very heavy, difficult to trim, brittle


### 2.5: Running Rail Supports and Fastenings

#### 2.5.1: Bulkhead Track Keys

- **Oak Keys**:
  - FOR - Eaasy to install, cheap, light and good electrical insulation 
  - AGAINST - Tend to shrink and fall out
- **Steel**:
  - FOR - Wear resistance, easy to install, tight fitting, good creep resistance
  - AGAINST - Need to be driven in tight, tendency to crush and fall out, tend to rust poor electricail insulation
- **PANLOCK KEYS**:
  - FOR - secure location and low maintenance
  - AGAINST - need special tool to install, tend to rust, poor electrical resistance

#### 2.5.2: Chairscrews and ferrules

![](image/2025-12-27-19-57-07.png)

- **Chairscrews**: to hold the chair or baseplate securely to the sleepers. Restrains the rails and hold the gauge.
- **Ferrules** : accommodate casting tolerances in chair and baseplate. Prevent screw and metals to contact.

#### 2.5.3: Flatbottom Track - rail clips

- **Pandrol Clips**

- **Fastclips**

#### 2.5.4: FB Rail vs BH Rail

- **Flat Bottom rail**:
  - Baseplate with chairscrews and ferrules.
  - Special baseplate for check rail.
  - Pandrol shoulders casted into concrete sleepers.
  - Pandrol with insulators and rail seat pad, directly seated on concrete sleepers.
- **Bull Head Rail**:
  - Chairs with chariscrews, ferrules and keys
  - Keys - oak or steel (two types: Mills and Panlock)
  - Special Chairs for check rail

#### 2.5.5: Resilient Baseplate - composite with rubber insert

  - Longer lifetime 
- **DIS**:
  - Energy dissipation into noise 
  - Bulky component in space constained area

#### 2.5.6: Track Bed

- **Ballast**:
  - Purpose:
    - To absorb and disperse track load through track foundations
    - Restrain movement of sleepers
    - Provide drainage
- **Ballast Sleepers**:
  - **Granite Ballast - preferred**
    - FOR - hard stay sharps, strong abration resistant
    - AGAINST - heavy and expensive
  - **Limestone - was most common in LU**
    - FOR- cheap, resonable drainage
    - AGAINST - scarce resorce in the UK, cannot be used with concrete sleepers
  - **Ash Ballast**
    - Waste product from coal power station. Mainly in depot.
- **Typical Faults**:
  - Wet Spot: Train dynamic movement makes the underkying clay being drawn up into the ballast, thus blocks the drainage and loose the support.
