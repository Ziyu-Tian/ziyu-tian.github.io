# Pway Class A - LU

## 1: Introduction 

### 1.1: Definition of Permanent Way and Track 

- **Permanent Way**:
    - All railway tracks in passenger service, the adjointing depots and sidings mostly electrified, timber / sleepers, cuttings, embankments, drainage and all associated features between and including the operational boundary fences.

- **Track**:
    - The permanent way and the ground within 2 m of any running rail, but exlcuing station platforms and areas guarded by physical barriar.

### 1.2: Main Components of PWay

- Running rails & joints
- Switches and corssings
- Rail fastening 
- Sleepers and timbers
- Conductor rails and fittings
- Ballast and concrete
- Track Drainage 
- Surface vegetation 
- Boudndary fences
- Train arresters 
- Structure gauge

### 1.3: Purpose of the PWay 

- Support and guide the trains
- Provide a suitable running surface for wheels
- Provide adequate space for approved vehicles travelling at authorised speed
- Provide a suitable path for collector shoes
- Provide electrical paths & insulation for power and signalling
- Provide safe walking surface for maintenance / derailment 
- Enable drainage of surface water

### 1.4: Platform Train Interface (PTI)

- Important to safety and service performance
- Maybe necessary to use special measures to fix the track position
- Preference is to standardise dimensions between tracks and platform edge, but this can result in sub-optimal solutions

### 1.5: Wheel Rail Interface (WRI)

- The wheel treads are tapered and the rails are inclined at 1 in 20 to provide self steering.
- The wheels have flanges which on tighter radius curves (radius approximately 400 metres)
- The shape of the rial head and wheel profile are very important, including track gauge and track geometry.
- Lubrication is provided by track lubricators and in some cases also train mounted lubricators.

### 1.6: Conductor Rail - Shoe Gear Interface

- Necessary to have gap in the consuctor rails and ramps to guide shoes on and off the rails.
- Most conductor rails are steel but aluminium rails with a stainless steel top surface are also used for higher conductivity.

### 1.7: Point Systems

- Provide motor drives, position detection and locking mechanisms.
- In LU, switch rails and stretcher bars are classfied as PWay assets and the drive, detection and locking system classified as Signal assets.

### 1.8: Track Condition Monitoring 

Various condition measures are used for each form of degradtion:

- Irreversible Degradation:
  - Running rail wear
  - Running rail flaws
  - Conductor rail wear
- Reversible Degradation:
  - Running rail corrugation
  - Loss of track geometry
  - Ballast contamination (eg. wet beds)

LU PWay standards mandate a suite of inspections that provide information about track condition:

- Patrolling - visual

- Manufacturer, Type of steel, Year of manugacturing, Approx weight and Rail profile.

![](image/2025-12-28-20-35-33.png)


### 3.2: Fuel Gasses Used For Welding 

- All cylinders used for welding contain gas under pressure and are sealed.
- All cylinders are colour coded to a recognised standard to indetify contents.
- **Three main gases**:
  - *Oxygen*
  - *Acetylene*
    - Garlic odour
    - Highly flammable and ignites very easily in air.
    - **Can be used in all areas.**
  - *Propane*
    - Heavier than air, fish like odour
    - Flammable and makes it a high fire and explosion hazard.
    - **Open section only.**

![](image/2025-12-28-20-48-26.png)

### 3.3: Aluminothermic Welding 

- Used for Joining Rails and Defect Removal

- Following second word war - very small amount of welding via old Thermit
- 1949/50 - SmW was introduced.
- 1976/77 - SkV process was introduced.
  - Stronger welds
  - Welding process with short preheat
  - Reduction in process failures
  - Main Thermit weld used in LU / NR
  - Enhancements: SKV-E

- **Standard method for all Thermic process**:
  - 1: Rail gaps are produced either by flame cutting or mechanical saw. Checked squareness and verticality.
  - 2: Align the rail.
  - 3: Moulds are fitted and checked for position relative to the gap.
![](image/2025-12-28-21-25-55.png)

  - 4: Add welding portions (4 main ingredients)
    - Aluminium Powder
    - Ion Oxide
    - Mild Steel
    - Ferro-manganese  
  - 5: Rail ends preheating started when the preheater is locked in the moulds. The sand core is dried in this process.
  - 6: The crucible is placed into position on top of the moulds and portion ignited. 
    - Thermit reaction takes place
    - Weld metal is released into the moulds.

![](image/2025-12-28-21-49-23.png)

  - 7: Remove all the support equipment at the set time following pouring.
  - 8: At prescribed time:
    - Weld debris is removed
    - Fastenings are replaced
    - Weld is ground within 25 mins to profile.

### 3.4: Manual Metal Arcing (MMA) Welding Processes

#### 3.4.1: Fusion Welding Material

![](image/2025-12-29-09-37-27.png)

#### 3.4.2: MMA Welding Processes

- The electrode is preferred method for the weld repair of rails.
- Step 1: When the arc is struck between metal rod (electrode) and the workpiece, both end surface melt to form a weld pool.
- Step 2: Simultaneous melting of the flux coating on the rod will form the sheilding gas to protect the weld pool.
- Step 3: The slag will then solidfy, cool and must be chipped off the weld bead when the welding is completed.

![](image/2025-12-29-09-48-45.png)

#### 3.4.3: Flash Butt Welding

- To begin, the rails are positioned with a precise gap determined by factors such as materials.
- The rails are clamped, and a high current is applied.
- Once the correct temperature is reached, the current is stopped, and the rails are rapidly pressed together. The action forges the two rails into a single continuous rail.

![](image/2025-12-29-10-00-38.png)

#### 3.4.4: Future in Welding

- HWR / HRW (Hot Weather Rail) Weld process for the removal of defects

## 4: Track Recording and Analysis

### 4.1: Benifits of Track Geometry Measurement (Static and Dynamic)

- For passenger comfort and Asset life
- The dynamically measure benifits:
  - True reflection of maximum deflection under load
  - Record movement because of voids under sleepers
  - Ability to record large section of track in short time
  - Eliminate human errors

### 4.2: Measurement Principles

#### 4.2.1: Geometry System Basics

![](image/2025-12-29-10-46-03.png)

#### 4.2.2: Measurement Parametres

- Track Geometry:
  - Gauge (mm)
  - Cant / Crosslevel (mm)
  - Twist (2m and 10m) (mm)
  - Top (Vertical Profile) (mm)
  - Alignment (Lateral) (mm)

- Dynamic cross-level (no longer required in S1159)
- Wheel unload 
- Curvature
- Corrugation (or Equivalent Rail Roughness)

- **Gauge**:
  - Distance between the two rails measured 14 mm below the crown of the rail.
  - Norminal gauge is 1435 mm.

![](image/2025-12-29-17-02-17.png)

- **Vertical Profile (TOP)**
  - The difference of rail height.
  - With 25m filter fitted.

![](image/2025-12-29-20-43-51.png)

- **Cant and Twist**:
  - *Cant*: Difference in height of two rails (the outer rail is normally higher than inner one in curves)
  - *Twist*: Difference in Cant over a set distance, e.g. 2m between wheel centres and 10m between two bogie centres.

![](image/2025-12-29-20-49-31.png)

- **Wheel Unload**
  - Wheel unload is a conbination of 2m and 10m twist on LU passenger stock.
  - 100% wheel unload will lead to o downward force being applied from wheel to the rail.
  - General wheel unload parameters are set so that rains experience less than 60% Wheel unload. 

![](image/2025-12-29-21-10-07.png)


- **Alignment**
  - Alignment measures the difference along the running rails.
  - A perfect continuous curve gives zero reading.

![](image/2025-12-29-21-19-49.png)


- **3 main causes of Geometry fault related derailment**:
  - Loss of gauge
  - Twist fault resulting in wheel unload
  - Cyclic Top 

- **Noise and vehicle / track damage**:
  - Rail Roughness or Corrugation

### 4.3: TRV and ATMS Data Collection 

#### 4.3.1: TRV Digitisation 

- Digitised TRV output into Excel
- All Data processed off train

#### 4.3.2: ATMS

- Nince passenger trains fitted with Automated Track Monitoring Systems (ATMS)
- Gives geometry and supporting data when it is in service
- ATMS could find faults not seen by legacy systems including TRV

- **Benefits**:
  - Proven unattended data collection
  - Next day data processing
  - Additional data - Noise and Vibration, and video

![](image/2025-12-30-06-33-39.png)


#### 4.3.3: Comparison between ATMS and TRV

- *TRV does well*:
  - Transducer on axles for vertical measurement. ATMS beam is offset from the axle, which can under report faults, e.g. twist.
  - TRV covers low speed areas where ATMS laser shuts down for safety reasons.
  - Dedcated vehicle gives pro=iority access to the train.
- *ATMS deos well*:
  - ATMS does not smooth out Top faults like TRV.
  - ATMS laser based system is better than TRV white light system.
  - Higher recording frequency.
  - Location accuracy from RFID tags compared with manual sync on TRV.

#### 4.3.3: Data Outputs

- **Discrete Exceedences**:
  - Safety Standard (SS)
    - Need to be inspected within 24 hours
  - Maintenance Limit (ML)
  - Maintenance Target (MT)
  - Can pose a risk of derailment and may require immediate action (e.g. speed restriction)

![](image/2025-12-30-09-25-05.png)

- **ISSE Process**
  - Inspection fo Safety Standard Exceedence (ISSE)
  - SS Fault must be inspected with 24 hours.
  - Inspection now only has to be visual to check ok for traffic wholst repair is arranged
  - Fault combination should follow S1159.
- **Standard Deviation**
  - A quantitative representation of ride quality, allowing every 100m of track to be assigned a value for a parameter.
  - Good indication of overall Track condition
  - SD data can be used to plan maintenance activities like tamping and access degradation.

![](image/2025-12-30-09-41-10.png)

- **DataMap Application**
  - Notification of new / rapidly degrading faults
  - Trendin of faults with predicted timescale to fix
  - Fault priority based in degradation rates not just the current value.
- **Spurious Data**
  - Readings from Dynamic system do not match site static readings.
  - Readings can be confirmed as spurious by a competent track recording engineer.
- **Inherent Gepmetry**
  - Inherent geometry is valid reading, but the nature of track alignment / construction cause an inherent fault.
  - Must be recorded on a centrally held register.
- **Recording Frequency** 
  - **TRV:** 8 weeks Cat A and B track where ATMS does not run.
  - **ATMS**: Minimum once every 28 days in areas covered by ATMS.

-  **Recording Coverage**:
   -  TRV and ATMS covered A, B and C track.
   -  Not decalred areas must be inspect by other means.
