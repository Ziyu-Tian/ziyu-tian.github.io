# Pway Class A - LU

## 1: Introduction 

### 1.1: Definition of Permanent Way and Track 

- **Permanent Way**:
    - All railway tracks in passenger service, the adjointing depots and sidings mostly electrified, timber / sleepers, cuttings, embankments, drainage and all associated features between and including the operational boundary fences.

- **Track**:
    - The permanent way and the ground within 2 m of any running rail, but exlcuing station platforms and areas guarded by physical barriar.

### 1.2: Main Components of PWay

- Running rails & joints
- Switches and corssings
- Rail fastening 
- Sleepers and timbers
- Conductor rails and fittings
- Ballast and concrete
- Track Drainage 
- Surface vegetation 
- Boudndary fences
- Train arresters 
- Structure gauge

### 1.3: Purpose of the PWay 

- Support and guide the trains
- Provide a suitable running surface for wheels
- Provide adequate space for approved vehicles travelling at authorised speed
- Provide a suitable path for collector shoes
- Provide electrical paths & insulation for power and signalling
- Provide safe walking surface for maintenance / derailment 
- Enable drainage of surface water

### 1.4: Platform Train Interface (PTI)

- Important to safety and service performance
- Maybe necessary to use special measures to fix the track position
- Preference is to standardise dimensions between tracks and platform edge, but this can result in sub-optimal solutions

### 1.5: Wheel Rail Interface (WRI)

- The wheel treads are tapered and the rails are inclined at 1 in 20 to provide self steering.
- The wheels have flanges which on tighter radius curves (radius approximately 400 metres)
- The shape of the rial head and wheel profile are very important, including track gauge and track geometry.
- Lubrication is provided by track lubricators and in some cases also train mounted lubricators.

### 1.6: Conductor Rail - Shoe Gear Interface

- Necessary to have gap in the consuctor rails and ramps to guide shoes on and off the rails.
- Most conductor rails are steel but aluminium rails with a stainless steel top surface are also used for higher conductivity.

### 1.7: Point Systems

- Provide motor drives, position detection and locking mechanisms.
- In LU, switch rails and stretcher bars are classfied as PWay assets and the drive, detection and locking system classified as Signal assets.

### 1.8: Track Condition Monitoring 

Various condition measures are used for each form of degradtion:

- Irreversible Degradation:
  - Running rail wear
  - Running rail flaws
  - Conductor rail wear
- Reversible Degradation:
  - Running rail corrugation
  - Loss of track geometry
  - Ballast contamination (eg. wet beds)

LU PWay standards mandate a suite of inspections that provide information about track condition:

- Patrolling - visual
- Junctionwork Inspections - visual and measured
- Measured Inspections - work scoping 
- Track Recording Vehicle (TRV), ATMS
- Rail Inspections - 'B' scan (ultrasonic), RSCM (magnetic flux)
- Prevention of Bukcling Inspections
