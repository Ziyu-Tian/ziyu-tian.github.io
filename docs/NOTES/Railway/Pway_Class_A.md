# Pway Class A - LU

## 1: Introduction 

### 1.1: Definition of Permanent Way and Track 

- **Permanent Way**:
    - All railway tracks in passenger service, the adjointing depots and sidings mostly electrified, timber / sleepers, cuttings, embankments, drainage and all associated features between and including the operational boundary fences.

- **Track**:
    - The permanent way and the ground within 2 m of any running rail, but exlcuing station platforms and areas guarded by physical barriar.

### 1.2: Main Components of PWay

- Running rails & joints
- Switches and corssings
- Rail fastening 
- Sleepers and timbers
- Conductor rails and fittings
- Ballast and concrete
- Track Drainage 
- Surface vegetation 
- Boudndary fences
- Train arresters 
- Structure gauge

### 1.3: Purpose of the PWay 

- Support and guide the trains
- Provide a suitable running surface for wheels
- Provide adequate space for approved vehicles travelling at authorised speed
- Provide a suitable path for collector shoes
- Provide electrical paths & insulation for power and signalling
- Provide safe walking surface for maintenance / derailment 
- Enable drainage of surface water

### 1.4: Platform Train Interface (PTI)

- Important to safety and service performance
- Maybe necessary to use special measures to fix the track position
- Preference is to standardise dimensions between tracks and platform edge, but this can result in sub-optimal solutions

### 1.5: Wheel Rail Interface (WRI)

- The wheel treads are tapered and the rails are inclined at 1 in 20 to provide self steering.
- The wheels have flanges which on tighter radius curves (radius approximately 400 metres)
- The shape of the rial head and wheel profile are very important, including track gauge and track geometry.
- Lubrication is provided by track lubricators and in some cases also train mounted lubricators.

### 1.6: Conductor Rail - Shoe Gear Interface

- Necessary to have gap in the consuctor rails and ramps to guide shoes on and off the rails.
- Most conductor rails are steel but aluminium rails with a stainless steel top surface are also used for higher conductivity.

### 1.7: Point Systems

- Provide motor drives, position detection and locking mechanisms.
- In LU, switch rails and stretcher bars are classfied as PWay assets and the drive, detection and locking system classified as Signal assets.

### 1.8: Track Condition Monitoring 

Various condition measures are used for each form of degradtion:

- Irreversible Degradation:
  - Running rail wear
  - Running rail flaws
  - Conductor rail wear
- Reversible Degradation:
  - Running rail corrugation
  - Loss of track geometry
  - Ballast contamination (eg. wet beds)

LU PWay standards mandate a suite of inspections that provide information about track condition:

- Patrolling - visual
- Junctionwork Inspections - visual and measured
- Measured Inspections - work scoping 
- Track Recording Vehicle (TRV), ATMS
- Rail Inspections - 'B' scan (ultrasonic), RSCM (magnetic flux)
- Prevention of Bukcling Inspections

### 2.10: Junctionwork

- **Function of junctionwork**:
  - Corss from one running line or route to another
  - Gain access to stabling or depot tracks
  - Gain access to a particular platform at station

- **Facing and Trailing Crossover**:
  - When trains moving towards the *switch rail rail head*, it will be called *Facing Crossover*.
  - When trains moving from a siding to a mainline (opposite to the switch rail head), it will be called *Trailing Crossover*.
  ![](image/2025-12-28-12-03-30.png)

- **Scissors Crossover**
  - Two single lead turnout overlapped to fomr a Scissors Crossover.
  - Allows trains moving between upstream and downstream.

![](image/2025-12-28-12-08-20.png)

- **Trap Switches**
  - Avoid siding trains slipping into mainline by accident.
![](image/2025-12-28-12-09-12.png)


- **Diamond Crossing**
  - No switches in the trunout, the signalling interlocking is used as protection.
  - Only two direction allowed.

![](image/2025-12-28-12-39-44.png)

- **Double Slip**
  - Similar to Diamond Crossing, but additional swiches allow the movement from one direction to another.

![](image/2025-12-28-16-03-00.png)

### 2.11：Points (switches) 

- **Stretcher Bars & Brackets**
  - Purpose:
    - Transmits drive from one rail to another
    - Ensure no electrical isolation between switch rails
- **Flangeway**
  - The space between the switch rail and stock rail (the open side) must be designed to perimit width of wheel flanges.

![](image/2025-12-28-16-11-02.png)


- **Straightcut, Undercut and Rail Joggle**
  - Undercut / shallow depth / full depth profile provides extra space for flangeway (when switch rail is closed)
  - Extra 'joggle' will be provided in stock rail to provide flangeway. Note that point will be facing crossover only.

![](image/2025-12-28-16-36-34.png)
![](image/2025-12-28-16-38-40.png)

- **Supports and Fastenings**
  - Switchs could move laterally on slide chairs or baseplates.
  - Switch and stock rail are fixed with an anchor at heel.

- **Distance Blocks**
  - The block retain the swith in the moveable part between the end of planning and fixed heel.
![](image/2025-12-28-17-55-46.png)


- **Soleplates**
  - To maintain track gauge at the toes of points.
  - Fitted on top of the timber under the slide charis/baseplates, and are secured in position by the chariscrews hilding the slide chairs in position.

![](image/2025-12-28-18-37-03.png)


- **Switch Anchors (Bullhead)**
  - Purpose - to fix together the switch and stock rails providing:
    - A fixed pivot point for switch rail
    - Prevention of longitudinal movement.
![](image/2025-12-28-18-38-57.png)


- **Heel Blocks (Flat Bottom)**
  - Purpose - to fix together the switch and stock rails (same as Anchors in BH track)
  
![](image/2025-12-28-18-40-46.png)


- **Twist Rails**
  - Twist the rails to change height of the rails, thus allow smooth transition between different track levels.
- **Precurving of Rails**
  - Ensure corrct curvature of stock and switch rail before installation.
  - Balancing of the energy required to normalise or revere points for the correct switch fit and providing a correct flange way.

### 2.13: Common Crossing & Obtuse Crossing

#### 2.13.1: Unbroken Crossing - Common Crossing

- Using continious rail between the two rails without 'jumping'.
- Fully fabricated
- Used for unsignalled moves, where all traffic is on one route.

- **Types of Construction**:
  - Fully fabricated or Part fabricated 
  - Cast centre block 

- **Cast Centre Block Crossings**

- Opposite common corssing noses.
- Opposite the point rail nose-wing rail-point nose gaps of an obtuse crossings.


### 2.15: Concrete Bearers with Switch Panels

- All concrete bearers (sleepers) have to be custom cast to take account of the different crossing angles.

![](image/2025-12-28-19-38-53.png)


- Switch pannels on concrete bearers include yhe slide base plate and heel charis fixed to the bearer with a rubber pad beneath the baseplate.

- Beyond the heel the concrete bearers become deeper to maintain a constant construction depth where the rail is directly fixed with cast in Pandrol shoulders.

![](image/2025-12-28-19-42-51.png)


- Composite Bearers (recycled plastic) has been used to provide similar performance.
